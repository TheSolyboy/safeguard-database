Welcome to the official SafeGuard repository for maintaining our **scam link** and **scammer user ID** databases.

## 📁 What’s Inside

This repo contains two JSON files updated **weekly**:

- `scam_links.json` – A collection of known scam/suspicious URLs.
- `scammer_ids.json` – A list of Discord user IDs reported or confirmed as scammers.

These files are used by the **SafeGuard Discord bot** to protect servers in real-time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔗 Scam Link Detection

When a user sends a message containing a known scam link, SafeGuard **instantly replies with a warning**:

### 🧠 Scammer ID Detection

SafeGuard can scan your server for known scammer accounts using a command. It flags users whose IDs match our regularly updated database:
